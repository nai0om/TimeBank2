hello my readme


===For those who have problems===
1. Add 'cache' dir in 'application'
2. Setting up database for your own, create new database and import 'timebank.sql', and re-config in 'application/config/setup_database.php' for your database username, password, hosts, database name.
3. If you encounter 500 internal error, you should see the apache configuration file 'httpd.conf' and uncomment the line that contains 'mod_rewrite.so'
4. If you can see the first page, but can't go further. please see 'modules/database/classes/kohana/database/mysql.php' (I not yet found the beautiful solution.) insert your database username, password, hosts, database name here before the 'try' on the line 49, I think, or just like this.
	$username = 'your_username';
	$password = 'your_password';
	$database = 'your_database_name';
5. If you see the error, something like this '<? endif ?>' you should make sure that your 'php.ini' allow 'short_open_tag'
